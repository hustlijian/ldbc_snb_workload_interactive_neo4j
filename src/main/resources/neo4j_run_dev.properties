#cache_type=soft
	#Provides optimal utilization of the available memory. Suitable for high performance traversal. 
	#May run into GC issues under high load if the frequently accessed parts of the graph does not fit in the cache.
	#This is the default cache implementation.
#cache_type=weak
	#Provides short life span for cached objects. Suitable for high throughput applications where a larger portion of 
	#the graph than what can fit into memory is frequently accessed.
#cache_type=strong
	#This cache will hold on to all data that gets loaded to never release it again. Provides good performance if your 
	#graph is small enough to fit in memory.
cache_type=hpc
	#Provides means of assigning a specific amount of memory to dedicate to caching loaded nodes and relationships. 
	#Small footprint and fast insert/lookup. Should be the best option for most scenarios. See below on how to configure it. 
	#Note that this option is only available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
