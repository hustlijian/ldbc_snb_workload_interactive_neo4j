    QUERY 7

    Description
        For the specified person, this query gets the most recent likes of any of the personâ€™s posts.
        Likes from outside the direct connections are specially gratifying, hence these are flagged.
        The latency between the post and the like is also reported. Speed of reaction is a potential correlate of interest.
        The results are ordered descending by creation date of the like, and then ascending by liker URI, and the top 20 are returned.
    Parameter
        Person
    Result (for each result return)

        Person.firstName (for the person who likes the post)
        Person.lastName (for the person who likes the post)
        CreationDate of the like
